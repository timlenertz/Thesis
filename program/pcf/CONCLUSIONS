POINT CLOUD PROGRAMMING
- better to store working point cloud in separate buffers for xyz,colors,normals,etc
- benefit from point class inheritance
- support masking, differentiate between invalid points and masked points
- define type for position (!= point)
- no inherit point cloud from space object, make space object reference the data
- better name for unorganized_pc
- invalidatable_point 

CPP
- not mix class/struct (predeclarations problem)
- use mutable
- own impl instead of OpenMP
- not too much template metaprogramming, use dynamic polymorphism where possible
- not use C++ for UI

APPLICATION
- avoid wasting time on UI
- use scripting langlage command line instead of UI
- plan it from beginning
