Framework is set up for:
	ICP variants
	kNN
	Closest point
	Projection/Backprojection
	Manual editing
	Image analysis (OpenCV)
	Range point cloud grid

Methods for registration.
Output is the transformation matrix -> no loss possible.

Registration of low and high res.


Define an error metric (at scale of high res).
	Tri-step: coarse (manual), fine (ICP), finer (choose among samples)
	-> Comparison with given reference transformation (if available?)
	Look at domain where correspondence error metric is lowest
	f: trans -> err
	
	
	
	Goal: Augment information in low res.


Registration on the level of (range) images
	For near-planar surfaces like 012 engraving.
	Problem for ICP: the different occluded sides. (shadows)
	vary correspondence weight according to local density?
	-> density map (as XYZI point cloud with closest point finding; or voxel octree)
	-> use kNN, maybe limit to same plane
	-> or normal vector VS camera direction
	-> adjust according to point cloud density (frontal points grid)
	--> ICP focusses on the good data

	
	Pass from image 2D transformation to 3D point set transformation
	Define camera s.t. most of it is in picture for both.
	3+ images: Range Images HI, LO, photographs


Interpretation of color image or photograph
	Determine light source
	Use relief to deduce depth/contours
	

Helper structures for alignment
	Geometric primitives (lines/circles/etc using Hough transform on proj image)
	

Other
	Surface reconstruction
