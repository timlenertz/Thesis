Framework is set up for:
	ICP variants
	kNN
	Closest point
	Projection/Backprojection
	Manual editing
	Image analysis (OpenCV)
	Range point cloud grid

Methods for registration.
Output is the transformation matrix -> no loss possible.

Registration of low and high res.
	Define an error metric (at scale of high res).
	Goal: Augment information in low res.

Registration on the level of range images
	For near-planar surfaces.
	For example 012 engraving.
	Pass from image 2D transformation to 3D point set transformation
	Define camera s.t. most of it is in picture for both.
	3+ images: Range Images HI, LO, photographs
