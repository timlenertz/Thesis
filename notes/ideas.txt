	Densification of low resolution cloud
	Use of continous representation (Gaussian distribution)
	Depth maps+photos image analysis
	Monoplottings
	Point cloud <-> depth map <-> image

3 methods
	Range image superresolution of low resolution pc
	Downsample high resolution pc, and then refine
	Density invariant continuous representation of both
