implementation: design towards full point cloud fusion solution
allowing implementation of solutions in appropriate framework

(1)
research (= learning theory only)
+
implement:
basic framework adjusted for efficiency and large data sets
IO solution —> PLY import/export DONE
generate artificial data sets (transformation, down/up sampling, camera fov, etc)
most generic but efficient ICP implementation (C++ metaprogramming)
several ICP variants
other registration algorithms
Range Image IO —> structured point sets (as extension to point cloud)

goal: do experiments on data sets
—> get insight on which methods are well suited for which kinds of data

experiment with ICP
