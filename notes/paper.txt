Registration (State of the Art & Classifications)
	Introduction
		Exclude non-rigid
		Idealized model (continuous surfaces)
		Data as approximation of ideal model (pt distrib, errors, density, ...)
		Math preliminaries
		Terminology used in literature, conventions for this paper
		General definition of problem (distance minimization)

	Survey of litterature
		Branches of existing studies (point set math, range image analysis, geo-informatics, ...)
		Short history of ICP and other registration algorithms

	Classification of registration algorithms (by approach, aims, input requirements, use case)
		ICP framework
		Point correspondences choice
		Continuous representation (kernel function)
		Normal Distrubution Transform
		4-Point Congruent Set
	
	Classification of use cases/input data
		Large/small object
		Surrounding scenery, masking requirements
		Noise
		Time difference, changing features (waving flag, people, etc)
		Approximatively planer surfaces
		Level of overlap
		Variability of density
		
		

Large model registration
	Characteristics of large models
		Different densities (global model <=> detail)
		Varying densities (with origin distance)		
		Large point sets
		Coarse+fine alignment, with help of photos
		Alignment of near-planar objects (e.g. engraving)
		Noise removal (people walking by)
	
	Present Townhall scanning project
		Available data (scans, poses, photos)
		Restriction to global<=>detail alignment
		Examples of data sets to align
		


Experiments !
	Aim of experiments
		Evaluate registration algorithms:
			stability
			convergence time
			quality ...
		On different data set types
	
	Methodology
	Present results (graphs)
	--> Conclusion about requirements for new algorithm


Methods
	Ideas:
		- Superresolution of low res pc
		- Downsample high res pc
		- Continuous representation
		- PC - photo - PC error minimization
			(combine Perspective-to-Point and ICP)
	

Side Problems
	Visualization
	Structures for efficient closest point finding (kdtree vs grid)


Implementation
	Architecture
	Dependencies (Eigen, OpenCV)
	Efficient use of C++ (inlining, static polymorphism)
	OpenMP, SIMD
	Memory alignment, pagination
	Point cloud structures
	ROOT, cling integration for interface
	Visualizer, editing environment
	Encountered difficulties
