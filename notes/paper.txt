Title: Registration and fusion of large scale 3D models ?
Orig: Recalage et fusion de modèles numérisés tridimensionnels de grande taille

Abstract

Introduction
	Overview on study methodology, different chapters

3D Documentation	
	Use cases
	Mathematical definition of point cloud, range image
	Operations on point clouds
	Operations on range images + photos
	Emphasis on registration+merging
	Terminology used in literature, conventions for this paper

Preliminary math (RANSAC, least squares, homogeneous coords)
	put where?

Registration Methods (State of the art, Survey of litterature/Classifications)
	Exclude non-rigid

	Branches of existing studies (point set math, range image analysis, geo-informatics, …)
	General definition of problem (distance minimization)
	Classification of registration algorithms (by approach, aims, input requirements, use case)
	ICP variations
		Distance function
		Cost function
		

Large model registration
	Define range/context of problem studied here
	Experiments using existing algorithms, results

Methods/Solution
	

Implementation
	Present PCF
	Defend architecture
	Handling of space+time efficiency for large data
	

Results
	Fused townhall/cave model
	Scanning workflow
