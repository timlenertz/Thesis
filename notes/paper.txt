Title: Registration and fusion of large scale 3D models ?
Orig: Recalage et fusion de modèles numérisés tridimensionnels de grande taille

Abstract

Introduction
	Overview on study methodology, different chapters

3D Documentation	
	Use cases
	Laser scan practive, introduction
	Idealized model (continuous surfaces), data (point cloud, range image), form (pt distribution)
	Operations on point clouds (overview)
	Operations on range images + photos (overview)
	Emphasis on registration+merging
	Terminology used in literature, conventions for this paper



Registration Methods (State of the art, Survey of litterature/Classifications)
	Exclude non-rigid
	Branches of existing studies (point set math, range image analysis, geo-informatics, …)
	General definition of problem (distance minimization)
	Classification of registration algorithms (by approach, aims, input requirements, use case)
	ICP variations
		Distance function
		Cost function
		

Large model registration
	Define range/context of problem studied here
	Subproblems:
		Different densities (global model <=> detail)
		Varying densities (with origin distance)		
		Large point sets
		Coarse+fine alignment, with help of photos
		Alignment of near-planar objects (e.g. engraving)
		Noise removal (people walking by)
	Data form (ie distribution of points) is different -> adjustments necessatry for ICP
	Out-of-core (streaming) VS in-core (pagination)
	

Methods/Solution
	3 levels: range image, point set, continuous representation
	

Implementation
	Present PCF
	Defend architecture
	Handling of space+time efficiency for large data
	

Results
	Fused townhall/cave model
	Scanning workflow
