Class scrreprt Warning: Usage of deprecated font command `\bf'!
(scrreprt)              You should note, that in 1994 font command `\bf' has
(scrreprt)              been defined for compatiblitiy to Script 2.0 only.
(scrreprt)              Now, after two decades of LaTeX2e and NFSS2, you
(scrreprt)              shouldn't use such commands any longer and within
(scrreprt)              KOMA-Script usage of `\bf' is definitely deprecated.
(scrreprt)              See `fntguide.pdf' for more information about
(scrreprt)              recommended font commands.
(scrreprt)              Note also, that KOMA-Script will remove the definition
(scrreprt)              of `\bf' anytime until release of about version 3.20.
(scrreprt)              But for now, KOMA-Script will replace deprecated `\bf'
(scrreprt)              by `\normalfont \bfseries ' on input line 25.

I can't figure out why you would want to use a tab mark
here. If you just want an ampersand, the remedy is
simple: Just type `I\&' now. But if some right brace
up above has ended a previous alignment prematurely,
you're probably due for more error messages, and you
might try typing `S' now just to see what is salvageable.

I can't figure out why you would want to use a tab mark
here. If you just want an ampersand, the remedy is
simple: Just type `I\&' now. But if some right brace
up above has ended a previous alignment prematurely,
you're probably due for more error messages, and you
might try typing `S' now just to see what is salvageable.

The control sequence at the end of the top line

misspelled it (e.g., `\hobx'), type `I' and the correct
spelling (e.g., `I\hbox'). Otherwise just continue,

Class scrreprt Warning: Usage of deprecated font command `\bf'!
(scrreprt)              You should note, that in 1994 font command `\bf' has
(scrreprt)              been defined for compatiblitiy to Script 2.0 only.
(scrreprt)              Now, after two decades of LaTeX2e and NFSS2, you
(scrreprt)              shouldn't use such commands any longer and within
(scrreprt)              KOMA-Script usage of `\bf' is definitely deprecated.
(scrreprt)              See `fntguide.pdf' for more information about
(scrreprt)              recommended font commands.
(scrreprt)              Note also, that KOMA-Script will remove the definition
(scrreprt)              of `\bf' anytime until release of about version 3.20.
(scrreprt)              But for now, KOMA-Script will replace deprecated `\bf'
(scrreprt)              by `\normalfont \bfseries ' on input line 505.
